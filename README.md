# dredd-hooks-rust â€¢ Dredd HTTP API testing integration for Rust [![Crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/dredd-hooks.svg)]() [![License](https://img.shields.io/crates/l/dredd-hooks.svg)](LICENSE)

This package contains a Rust Dredd hook handler which provides a bridge between the [Dredd API Testing Framework](http://dredd.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)
 and Rust environment to ease implementation of testing hooks provided by [Dredd](http://dredd.readthedocs.org/en/latest/). Write Dredd hooks in Rust to glue together [API Blueprint](https://apiblueprint.org/) with your Rust project.

Not sure what these Dredd Hooks are?  Read the Dredd documentation on [them](http://dredd.readthedocs.org/en/latest/hooks/).

The following are a few examples of what hooks can be used for:

- loading db fixtures
- cleanup after test step or steps
- handling authentication and sessions
- passing data between transactions (saving state from responses to stash)
- modifying request generated from blueprint
- changing generated expectations
- setting custom expectations
- debugging via logging stuff

## Installation

### Global installation

If you don't have it already, install the Dredd CLI via [npm](npm):

```bash
npm install -g dredd
```

In order for the Dredd CLI to be able to interface with your test binaries, you need to have the `dredd-hooks-rust` binary installed, which you can get by running:

```bash
cargo install dredd-hooks
```

[npm]: https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/what-is-npm

### Per-project setup

To start testing your Rust project with Dredd, just add `dredd-hooks` to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
dredd-hooks = "0.1.0"
```

Or if you have [cargo-edit][cargo-edit] installed you can just run this on the command line:
```bash
cargo add dredd-hooks
```

[cargo-edit]: https://github.com/killercup/cargo-edit

## Usage example

Following this is a short example showcasing Dredd tests running against an `iron` server.

The name of the project in this example is assumed to be `dredd-rust-test`:

`test.apib`
```apib
# My Api
## GET /message
+ Response 200 (text/plain)
    Hello World!
```

`main.rs`:
```rust
extern crate iron;
extern crate router;
extern crate dredd_hooks;

use iron::prelude::*;
use router::Router;
use dredd_hooks::{HooksServer};

// HTTP endpoint
fn endpoint(_: &mut Request) -> IronResult<Response> {
    Ok(Response::with((iron::status::Ok, "Hello World!\n\n")))
}

fn main() {
    let mut hooks = HooksServer::new();
    // Start the server before any of the tests are running.
    hooks.before_all(Box::new(|tr| {
        ::std::thread::spawn(move || {
            let mut router = Router::new();
            router.get("/message", endpoint, "endpoint");

            Iron::new(router).http("127.0.0.1:3000").unwrap();
        });
        tr
    }));
    // Execute a hook before a specific test.
    hooks.before("/message > GET", Box::new(|mut tr| {
        // Set the skip flag on this test.
        // Comment out the next line and you should see a passing test.
        tr.insert("skip".to_owned(), true.into());

        tr
    }));
    HooksServer::start_from_env(hooks);
}
```

Run the command:
```bash
cargo build && dredd ./test.apib http://127.0.0.1:3000 --language=dredd-hooks-rust --hookfiles=target/debug/dredd-rust-test
```

You should now see Dredd trying to run the tests against the binary that was just compiled, but actually skipping the single test it tries to run because we told Dredd to do so via a `before` hook.
